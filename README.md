## FAQ

> Why did you make this is Python?

Well, this project is just ~~an excuse~~ a way for me to test/try out the functionality that [vscode-ext](https://github.com/CodeWithSwastik/vscode-ext) has. (and to learn to make vscode extensions!)

Maybe if this project gets big enough, I may switch to TypeScript.
